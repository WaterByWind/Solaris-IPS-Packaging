## core-local
Sample IPS package that provides a standard consistent hierarchy for `/usr/local` under which non-packaged software is traditionally installed.  This ensures the entire hierarchy is completely and properly installed with facilities to ensure the integrity of this hierarchy, regardless of broken or improperly installed software.

This package is just an example package and is typically not required.  Most software that installs to `/usr/local` ensures the proper directory path exists or is created as part of the install process.
